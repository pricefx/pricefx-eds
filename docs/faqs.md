There are two primary types: **content templates** and **layout templates**. **Content templates** allow authors to create and copy them as needed. For example, an author might start an article page by duplicating an existing article page.   **Layout templates** define the visual arrangement of content on a page, such as a 2-column layout for the main content. Implementing layout templates typically involves using a page metadata property like "theme" or "template", which is automatically applied as a className to the page’s body.

| Changes to the CSS / JS of blocks & also creation of a new block followed by code check-in ensures availability on the universal editor. There is no package installation on AEM. How exactly is code available on AEM? | Correct, there is NO deployment to AEM. The scripts from the Edge Delivery Services project are loaded directly onto the page in AEM. Adobe uses a reverse proxy for that on /content/site.resource/<path-to-resource-on-project>, e.g., /content/site.resource/scripts/aem.js. We do so to workaround some CORS issues related to loading as modules. This is an implementation detail that may change in the future.                                                                                                                                               |
| We assume that the Head.html as the first HTML that's being invoked. How/ where is this configured?                                                                                                                     | The head.html is inlined into every page (not configurable). When serving the content for authoring in AEM, it loads the head.html to get the scripts and styles to add to the page but will ignore anything else in it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Can we create components by extending the OOB                                                                                                                                                                           | No, you are not supposed to do this. All the resource types are internal.        
| How will the dynamic media integration occur with Crosswalk, and what’s the plan for delivering assets from Edge Delivery Services (EDS)?                                                                             | Dynamic media integration with Crosswalk involves pulling all images used on any page into the media bus and serving them from there as optimized images (resized and in webp format if supported). Specific use cases for dynamic media integration should be clarified to determine the best approach.                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Is the blueprint-live copy content structure the ideal solution for implementing Multi-Site Management (MSM) site structure in AEM?                                                                                    | Yes, for implementing Multi-Site Management (MSM) site structure, the blueprint-live copy content structure is recommended. This approach supports MSM on the page level, allowing changes to live copies while maintaining inheritance for the entire page. However, note that component-level MSM is not supported.                                                                                                                                                                         |
| What’s the recommended approach for adding iframes or custom scripts in AEM while adhering to best practices?                                                                                                            | Best practice in AEM is to avoid using iframes whenever possible. Iframes can negatively impact page performance and user experience. If their use is unavoidable, consider delaying their loading to minimize their impact, especially for elements that are not part of the initial webpage experience or that appear only after user interaction.                                                                                                                                                     |
| Assuming we can utilize page properties like robot tags, canonical URLs, keywords, descriptions, or metadata, how are these properties supported in Edge Delivery Services (EDS)?                                              | Edge Delivery Services (EDS) fully supports the utilization of page properties like robot tags, canonical URLs, keywords, description, and metadata without requiring customization. These properties can be managed and utilized effectively within the EDS environment to optimize search engine visibility and overall site performance.                                                                                                                                                 |
| If we’re using Content Fragments (CF) for storing and fetching content in AEM, should we prefer GraphQL, or is there another recommended approach?                                                                      | When utilizing Content Fragments (CF) for storing and fetching content in AEM, the recommended approach is to integrate with the CF delivery APIs clientside. This approach ensures efficient retrieval and delivery of content stored in CFs while maintaining flexibility and scalability in implementation.                                                                                                                                                          |
